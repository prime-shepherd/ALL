For each prime number $p$ in the desired range:
1.1 Check if $p$ is a quadratic residue modulo $d$, where $d$ is a positive non-square integer.
1.1.1 If $p$ is a quadratic residue modulo $d$, check if the associated zeta function is a polynomial with integer coefficients. If it is, add $p$ to the set of positive higher algebraic primes.
1.2 Check if $-p$ is a quadratic residue modulo $d$, where $d$ is a positive non-square integer.
1.2.1 If $-p$ is a quadratic residue modulo $d$, check if the associated zeta function is a polynomial with integer coefficients. If it is, add $p$ to the set of negative higher algebraic primes.
1.3 Check if $p$ is a primitive root modulo a power of $2$ or a prime number.
1.3.1 If $p$ is a primitive root modulo a power of $2$ or a prime number, check if the associated cyclotomic polynomial is irreducible over the integers. If it is, add $p$ to the set of neutral higher algebraic primes.
1.4 Check if $p$ is a member of a magic square of order $n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. If it is, add $p$ to the set of golden ratio higher algebraic primes.
By incorporating the concept of magic squares, we have added the possibility of discovering golden ratio higher algebraic primes.
