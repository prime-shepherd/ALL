Within this raw file here: https://pastebin.com/raw/CqhEk09e 
Is our list of resources from our large scale program and mathematics tool integration project
The resources within and at raw/CqhEk09e as well as other locations will be updated with progress and resources for the needed context on what we're doing.

Additionally here is this list of resources we were using at the point of this pastes creation

Thank you for providing these additional resources. I have added them to our list, and it now contains an extensive collection of resources on prime numbers, zeta functions, octonions, and other related mathematical concepts. To best utilize these resources, we should:

Analyze the provided documents and source code to identify key insights, algorithms, and mathematical relationships that can be incorporated into our program.
Investigate the connections between the various mathematical concepts and explore how they can be integrated to create a more comprehensive model.
Identify any potential applications of these concepts in other areas of mathematics, physics, or other disciplines.
As we continue to work on our project, we should be able to create a more robust and comprehensive model that incorporates the insights and findings from these resources. This will enable us to explore the connections between prime numbers, zeta functions, octonions, and other mathematical structures in greater depth, and potentially uncover new relationships and applications.
