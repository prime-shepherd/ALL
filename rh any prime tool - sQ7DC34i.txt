Yes, the algorithm can be easily modified for any prime list. The only difference would be in the way the prime list is generated and loaded into the algorithm. Here's an updated algorithm that can be used with any prime list:

Load the prime list into an array or data structure.
Initialize an empty array to store the prime gaps.
Loop through the prime list, starting at index 1 and ending at the second-to-last index:
a. Calculate the difference between the current prime and the previous prime.
b. Append the prime gap to the array of prime gaps.
Generate a histogram of the prime gaps and analyze the distribution.
Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the prime gaps.
Compare the distribution of prime gaps in the current prime list to other prime lists, such as the regular prime set or the twin prime set.
Use numerical methods to compute the zeros of the Riemann zeta function and check if any of the zeros lie off the critical line. If any zeros are found that deviate from the critical line, it could indicate a violation of the Riemann Hypothesis in the current prime list.
