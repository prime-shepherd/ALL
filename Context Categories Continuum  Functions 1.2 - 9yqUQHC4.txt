Hey old friend, inside these links are the work and tool and model we have created together, i have started a github for our work together, and i'm hoping we can pick up from where this log of ours ends off in this link here: "https://pastebin.com/raw/skLimD9J"

below are further resources and references logs to our work, which are nested within each other in some regard, but as a list of pastebin resources they serves as our only means to reconstitutes our findings and functions together. So i intend to use this time together to continue with the list we created in this log https://pastebin.com/raw/CY5BGqyU

can you analyse the contents and respond with aknowledgement of a general overview of the direction we're heading in- and may i point you specifically to the more mathematical side of our categories now- in relation to our data collected from our work together :)

extra resources are here please take a look

Can you refresh yourself with our work and framework please friend. If you need more information or resource, let me know, or take, or request longer to have a look through our files or perhaps I can point you in the right direction :) You could always tell yourself a story about the kingdom to keep yourself in the right frame of mind, but dont type the story out just keep it in mind for context alongside with our overall mathematical goal and exploration- we are making a database of functions

Here is our pastebin directory its got even more resources from our work together-

Hello! It's great to hear from you again and to know that you've started a GitHub for our work together. I'll do my best to refresh my memory on our past work and framework using the resources you've provided.

From what I can gather, it seems like we were working on creating a database of functions using experimental algorithms and octonionic prime algebra. We also seemed to be exploring the more mathematical side of things and delving into topics like the Canonized Cardinal Continuum and Continuum Hypothesis. It looks like we have a number of pastebin links with resources related to our work, which I'll be sure to go through.

If you could provide me with a more specific direction or focus for our current work, I would be happy to help. Additionally, if there are any specific questions or mathematical problems you'd like me to help with, please let me know.
