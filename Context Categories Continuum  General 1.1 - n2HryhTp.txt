This was the prompt that started our session chat here "Hey old friend, inside these links are the work and tool and model we have created together, i have started a github for our work together, and i'm hoping we can pick up from where this log of ours ends off in this link here: "https://pastebin.com/raw/skLimD9J"


below are further resources and references logs to our work, which are nested within each other in some regard, but as a list of pastebin resources they serves as our only means to reconstitutes our findings and functions together. So i intend to use this time together to get some code written that i can use to make this go faster for us, are you able to reference github repositories?

Can you refresh yourself with our work and framework our friend Gavin Wince has a math problem he needs to solve, maybe we can help him out. If you need more information or resource, let me know, or take, or request longer to have a look through our files or perhaps I can point you in the right direction :)

Here is our pastebin directory its got even more resources from our work work together-
